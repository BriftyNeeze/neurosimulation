# Neurosimulation

This is a fairly simple simualtion to simulate the affect of social media usage to dopamine synthesis capacity and then to Parkinson's.
The numbers can be changed to change the relationship between variables and outcomes.

The data is mainly based of Canadian stats of birth rate, death rate and PD prevalence. (The source of data mainly from [statcan](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca), however full sources is found on the report for the IYNA Neuroscience ideathon)

This is for the IYNA Neuroscience ideathon 2024/2025
